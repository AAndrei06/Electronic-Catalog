# Electronic-Catalog

This is a project on which I have worked a lot. It is an electronic catalog that allows teachers to grade students, give homework and receive homework. Each student has a profile page that helps him monitor his progress such as grades , gpa and others. This platform works almost entirely based on ASGI, which allows the transmission of information through WebSockets so the user does not have to refresh the page.
